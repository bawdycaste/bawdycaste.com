This page is a guide to how we do things. It should answer most questions about behavior, protocol, and how we make decisions. Still have questions? Ask on Discord or check our [bylaws](https://bylaws.bawdycaste.com).

## 🎭 First Steps

The best way to get involved is to **jump right in**! Introduce yourself, talk to folks, ask questions, tell stories, try new things. We love new members and can't wait to get to know you better!

<div style="display: grid; gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

<div style="background: rgba(255, 51, 51, 0.15); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; border: 2px solid rgba(255, 51, 51, 0.3);">
<strong style="color: #ff6666; font-size: 1.2rem;">💬 Discord</strong><br>
Most day-to-day cast communication happens through Discord. Join our server, introduce yourself in <strong>#welcome</strong>, and wait for a Director to grant you the <code>@Cast Member</code> role so you can see all the channels.

<strong style="color: #66d9ff; font-size: 1.2rem;">🎬 At Shows</strong><br>
The best way to get to know the cast is to come to shows! You're not required to attend every show, but we'd love to have you as often as possible. Need a ride? Ask on Discord!

## 📋 Cast Responsibilities

There aren't many formal requirements — for the most part, you can decide how involved you want to be.

<div style="background: rgba(255, 51, 51, 0.1); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

<p><strong>Staying in Touch</strong><br>
Keep in touch via Discord, texts, or phone calls. If you'll be unavailable for a while, let the directors know.</p>

<p><strong>Checking In & Attending Shows</strong><br>
Respond to check-in reminders about upcoming shows. Directors will announce casting about a week before each show.</p>

<p><strong>Cast Meetings</strong><br>
We meet four times a year (February, May, August, November) to discuss big decisions. You're required to attend at least one meeting per year, but encouraged to attend all!</p>

<p><strong>Dues</strong><br>
$5 per quarter, collected once per year. If you can't afford it, let the Financial Secretary know and dues can be waived.</p>

## 👑 Cast Leadership

Most decisions are made democratically, but we elect people to specific roles:

<p><strong>Cast Directors</strong> (Elected every 2 years)<br>
Point of contact ensuring departments work smoothly. They help identify issues and get people together to solve them.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Secretary</strong> (Elected every 2 years)<br>
Tracks cast funds and reports to the cast. Helps budget for cool projects.</p>

<p><strong>Cast Council</strong><br>
Directors, Financial Secretary, and department heads. Decides on urgent matters between cast meetings.</p>

## ⚠️ General Guidelines

<div style="background: rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.15); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; border: 2px solid rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.4); margin: 1.5rem 0;">

<p><strong>Sexual Harassment: Don't do it!</strong><br>
We take this extremely seriously. Yes, people are scantily clad and sex jokes are the norm, but this must feel safe for all genders, sexualities, and orientations. <strong>Consent in all things</strong> is our highest value. If uncomfortable, bring it to leadership — you will be taken seriously.</p>

</div>

<div style="background: rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.15); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; border: 2px solid rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.4); margin: 1.5rem 0;">

<p><strong>Discrimination is Not Tolerated</strong><br>
Offensive jokes are part of our AP lines, but intentionally cruel remarks about sex, race, religion, sexual preference, gender identity, etc. are not acceptable. <strong>Be offensive, be shocking, but pay attention to whether you're punching up or down.</strong> The foundation of our cast is that everyone is accepted and worthy of respect.</p>

</div>

<div style="background: rgba(102, 217, 255, 0.15); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 0.75rem; border: 2px solid rgba(102, 217, 255, 0.4); margin: 1.5rem 0;">

<p><strong>Priorities Matter</strong><br>
Your health, family, school, work, and other commitments are more important than Rocky. It's perfectly acceptable to check out for personal obligations. <strong>Rocky Horror is not 100% of anyone's life.</strong> Just give as much notice as you can when checking out of a show.</p>
