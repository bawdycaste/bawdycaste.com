                <h2>Before the Show:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dress up! Embrace your inner freak and rock the most outrageous outfit you can imagine. Think fishnets, feathers, leather, glitter, and anything else that screams "Don't Dream It, Be It!"</li>
                    <li>Bring props! You'll need some essentials like a newspaper to wave during "Sweet Transvestite," a squirt gun for water pistols, a party horn for the "Fanfare," and maybe even some rubber gloves for the "Meat Loaf" scene. Check the theater's guidelines for any restrictions.</li>
                    <li>Learn the callouts! There are tons of lines and responses shouted during the film, adding to the interactive experience. You can find callout lists online or ask veterans in the audience for pointers. Remember, the spirit is more important than getting every word perfect!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>During the Show:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be loud and proud! Don't be shy, yell your callouts, sing along, and dance in the aisles. This is a safe space for letting loose and embracing your inner weirdo.</li>
                    <li>Follow the prompts: The Narrator and shadow cast will guide you through the participation, throwing rice during "Rice, Rice Baby," throwing toast during the wedding toast scene, and flashing the Frankenstein monster during his creation sequence.</li>
                    <li>Respect the cast and audience: This is a community event, so be courteous and respectful to everyone around you. Don't block anyone's view, and be mindful of any props that might be dangerous or disruptive.</li>
                    <li>Most importantly, have fun! This is a celebration of freedom, self-expression, and pure fun. So let loose, embrace the craziness, and do the Time Warp again and again!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Bonus Tips:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're a virgin, some shadow casts will "virgin sacrifice" you during the "Touch-a-Touch-a-Touch-a-Touch Me" scene. Don't worry, it's all in good fun!</li>
                    <li>Keep an eye out for surprises! Some shadow casts have additional props, jokes, and audience interactions that aren't in the original film.</li>
                    <li>Remember, there's no right or wrong way to experience Rocky Horror. Just do you, have fun, and don't dream it, be it!</li>
