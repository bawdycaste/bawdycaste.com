New members who have been assigned a department: fear not! This is how we get you started. Many of you will be assisting with costume changes, which is vital during a show. (And especially so during a theme show where we're dealing with different costuming.) If anyone is comfortable helping move props, that would be great as well. It's all a way for you to see how we operate during the chaos of a performance.

Call time at the theatre is 9:30. We'll be holding a cast meeting at 10:00 so everyone has a chance to introduce themselves to our new members, followed by Floor Show rehearsal (and Dr. Scott-on-a-hand-truck rehearsal).

The horror, the horror ...  -->
