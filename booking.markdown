# Book a Bawdy Caste Show!

Looking to add a raucous and unforgettable twist to your next midnight movie event?  The Bawdy Caste, a non-profit shadowcasting troupe, can turn your screening into an interactive experience filled with laughter, audience participation, and outrageous fun!

We specialize in transforming cult classics and beloved B-movies into live, comedic events. Our energetic cast acts out scenes alongside the film, adding hilarious commentary and improvisation that will have your audience roaring.

We’ve identified some key elements that help make an amazing show. We acknowledge that some of these things aren’t possible in all instances, but we appreciate our venues doing their part to make these things happen.
