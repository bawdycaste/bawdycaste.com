# Rocky Horror: How to Participate in the Fun

The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't just a movie, it's an experience! Here's a quick guide to joining in the fun:

## 1. The Callbacks:

- Audience yells witty responses during pauses in the film.
- Lines are well-practiced by fans, but feel free to add your own creative twist!
- Check out a "callback script" online for popular lines.

## 2. Props & Costumes:

- Audience members often dress up as characters from the film.
- Be flamboyant!
- Throw props at specific points in the movie (check the venue's guidelines for acceptable items like toast or rice).

## 3. The Time Warp:

- The iconic dance number! The movie will prompt you when to get up and dance along.
- Learn the moves beforehand if you want to bust a perfect Time Warp.

### Remember:

- It's all about having fun and expressing yourself.
- Don't worry about being perfect, new fans are welcome!
- Be respectful of the venue's rules and other audience members.

## Bonus Tip:
> Call out "Virgin!" if it's your first time experiencing Rocky Horror.
